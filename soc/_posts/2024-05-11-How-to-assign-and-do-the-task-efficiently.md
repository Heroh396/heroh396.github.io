Last week, I met a occasional case in my team. I assigned a simple task to my team member and I thought he would complete this task quickly with his experience.

But after a week, he still wouldn’t report the task result. Why? So I synced-up and knew that he completed it right at the afternoon of assignment day :D.

I know, the problem was from me. I thought this task was light and not urgent, so I didn’t set a clear deadline and didn’t check the progress (my team works online). Besides, it also reminds me of a task management model (matrix?) that I think quite useful and it’s shown as below.

- The model is based on 2 points: the task's importance and the assignee's capacity.
- For important tasks: the asignee should ask for opinions or propose ideas; after being accepted they do and report regularly
- For less important tasks: the asignee should explore and propose ideas, they should report when facing issue or any changes.
- For unimportant tasks: depending on capacity, the asignee report when starting and completing.

This model is based on the importance of the task and the experience of the assigned person. As for my team member, he had lots of experience and the task was not really important. Therefore, he should just notify when start and when complete the task. After that, I could review the result and assigned new task. In case of important tasks, we should report progress and follow up regularly.

I've seen this model before on TikTok, but even though I searched around TikTok, Google or even asked ChatGPT, I still couldn’t find its correct name. But I think it is effective for assigning and doing task for both assignor and assignee sides. Therefore, I re-created it from my memory and shared this model in the team with the hope this case never happens again.

So what about your perspective? With many of experience, do you think whether any problems or additional idea for this model? Thank you very much!
