### Intro

From today (March 22 2024), I will start a series of IC design.
It will be project-based series and I would like to implement a full chip design from RTL to GDS.

### Schedule
+ Mar 22, 2024: Initial brainstorming
+ Mar 23, 2024: Discuss with Lucero
+ Arp 04, 2024: First meeting to initial OpenIC project. Adding new key member (NVL)

### Plan

I started from create a mind map to answer the questions: what, why, when, who, how.

My team need a project management tool, so we decided to use Meistertask.
