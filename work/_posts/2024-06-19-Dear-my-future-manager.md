Dear my future manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your company. When I learned about the company's projects and vision, I was excited about the opportunity to contribute and grow in such an innovative environment.
### Who I Am
- Since my graduation, I have been passionate about researching cutting-edge technologies such as RISC-V, Neural Networks, Image Processing, NoC, and currently, 3D-IC and SSN.
- I am confident in my solid technical foundation and problem-solving skills to overcome any challenge.

### Why I Want to Join
- **Professional Growth**: My current environment has limited opportunities for professional growth due to the number of years of experience. I want to push my boundaries and continuously learn and improve my skills.
- **Collaborative Learning**: I am looking forward to working with talented individuals who share the same ambitions and are experts in the industry. This environment will allow me to learn and grow, both professionally and personally.
- **Cultural Experience**: I want to gain experience in Western countries, where the working style is completely different from the companies I have worked for in Vietnam, India, or Japan.
- **Contributing to Vision**: I am passionate about contributing my abilities and talents to help the company achieve its vision of creating innovative and impactful products.

### My Vision
- I aspire to differentiate myselfâ€”not just by seeking a high-income job in Vietnam but by creating real value through advanced technology products.
- I aim to contribute meaningfully to projects that have a significant impact on the industry and society.
I would love the opportunity to work under your guidance and contribute my knowledge and skills to further the company's vision.

Sincerely,
